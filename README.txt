A shortcut to the executable can be found in the same
directory as this README.txt file. Additionally, if you
choose to rebuild the executable from scratch, it will
most like be built into /GasPump/obj/Debug/GasPump.exe

A documentation PDF file is also available in the the
same directory as this README.txt file. In it you will
find descriptions of all my classes and their functions.
This pdf also contains photos of the Class and Sequence 
diagrams that I will be submitting with the hardcopy of
my project. Of course my personal MDAEFSM State diagram
was submitted for the earlier due date. I chose not to
include it because my source code is an adaptation of
the SAMPLE EFSM SOLUTION that was provided to all students
on Blackboard.
